# Evidock
EviDock is a Docker-based toolchain designed to automate the analysis of ingested files while seamlessly integrating human-driven investigation. It streamlines forensic workflows by extracting, processing, and structuring artifactsâ€”the digital evidence produced during analysis.

By leveraging containerized automation, EviDock efficiently identifies, classifies, and logs findings from PCAPs, binaries, documents, and more, reducing manual effort while ensuring that human analysts can interact with, interpret, and refine the generated artifacts.
